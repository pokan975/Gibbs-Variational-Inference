Codes for simulations of 1. Gibbs sampling on posterior DPMM, 2. coordinate ascend variational inference on posterior GMM and DPMM, 3. stochastic variational inference on posterior DPMM

The CAVI for DPMM is based on the paper "Variational inference for Dirichlet process mixtures" by David Blei and Michael I. Jordan (2006)

The SVI for DPMM is based on the paper ""Stochastic Variational Inference" by Matthew Hoffman (2013)
